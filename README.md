# EXEMPLAR


EXEMPLAR is an open relation extraction system originating from a research project at the University of Alberta. Relation extraction is the task of, given a text corpus, identifying relations (e.g., acquisition, spouse, employment) among named entities (e.g., people, organizations). While traditional systems are limited to the relations predetermined by the user, open relation extraction systems like EXEMPLAR are able to identify instances of any relation described in the text.

EXEMPLAR takes text files as input and extracts relations with two or more arguments. For instance, consider the following sentence:

    NFL approves Falcons' new stadium in Atlanta. 
    
Given this sentence, EXEMPLAR extracts an instance of the relation "approve new stadium" whose arguments are "NFL", "Falcons" and "Atlanta".

	Relation: approve new stadium
	    SUBJ: NFL
	    POBJ-OF: Falcons
		POBJ-IN: Atlanta

The role of an argument can be one of the following: SUBJ (subject), DOBJ (direct object) and POBJ (prepositional object). We often append the preposition of a POBJ argument to its role (e.g., "POBJ-IN" for preposition "in"). EXEMPLAR uses heuristics to choose a preposition for a POBJ argument whose preposition is implicit. This is the case for "Falcons" in the above example.

## Building

Download all dependencies (that do not exist in a Maven repository):

    $ sh dependencies.sh 

Compile and build JAR with Maven:

    $ mvn compile

## Running

    $ sh exemplar.sh parser input output

* parser: the parser to be used. Valid options are: stanford and malt.

* input: path to the document file or directory containing the document files. The tool will recursively look for .txt files in subdirectories.

* output: path to the file where the triples will be stored. 

## Sample Output

The output file contains one relation per line. Fields are separated by a tab in the following order: Subjects, Relation, Objects, Normalized Relation and Sentence. This is the output for our example:

    SUBJ:NFL#ORG <tab> approves new stadium <tab> POBJ-OF:Falcons#ORG,,POBJ-IN:Atlanta <tab> approve new stadium <tab> NFL approves Falcons ' new stadium in Atlanta .

The suffix in each argument corresponds to its type. Possible types are person (PER), organization (ORG), location (LOC) and miscellaneous (MISC). Subjects and objects are separated by double comma (",,"), if more than one exists.


## Libraries

The main libraries used in this tool are:

### Stanford Parser
 tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and dependency parsing.
### Malt Parser
 dependency parsing.
